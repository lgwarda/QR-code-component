## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For typography

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively implement responsive design using CSS Flexbox and media queries. I also gained a deeper understanding of how to use Google Fonts to enhance typography in my projects.

For example, I used the following CSS to style the QR code component:

```css
.qr-container {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 10px hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my knowledge of CSS Grid for layout management and exploring animations to create more engaging user interfaces. Additionally, I aim to delve deeper into accessibility best practices.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This resource helped me understand how to align items effectively using Flexbox.
- [Google Fonts Documentation](https://fonts.google.com/) - This was useful for learning how to incorporate custom fonts into my project.
